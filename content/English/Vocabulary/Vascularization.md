# Vascularization

**Basic**: The formation of blood vessels in tissues or organs.

**Advanced**: The process by which new blood vessels develop within a tissue, crucial for supplying oxygen and nutrients to cells in complex structures.

**Example**: "Improving vascularization in lab-grown organs is a major challenge for tissue engineering."
