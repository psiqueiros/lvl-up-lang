# Animal Models

**Basic**: Animals used in scientific research to study human diseases or conditions.

**Advanced**: Biological systems in non-human species that mimic aspects of human physiology or pathology, used to investigate disease mechanisms and test potential therapies.

**Example**: "Researchers use mouse models of Parkinson's disease to study the progression of motor symptoms."
