# Organoids

**Basic**: Tiny, simplified versions of organs grown in a lab.

**Advanced**: Three-dimensional cellular structures derived from stem cells that self-organize to resemble miniature organs, replicating some functions of their full-sized counterparts.

**Example**: "Scientists developed brain organoids to study the effects of the Zika virus on neural development."
