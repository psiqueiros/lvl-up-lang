# Three-dimensional culture systems

**Basic**: Lab techniques for growing cells in 3D instead of flat layers.

**Advanced**: Methods of culturing cells that allow them to grow and interact in all spatial dimensions, better mimicking the natural environment of tissues.

**Example**: "The research team used a three-dimensional culture system to observe how cancer cells invade surrounding tissues."
