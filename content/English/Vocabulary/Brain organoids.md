# Brain organoids

**Basic**: Tiny, simplified versions of brains grown in a lab.

**Advanced**: Three-dimensional cellular models that self-organize to mimic aspects of human brain development and structure, used for studying neurological processes and disorders.

**Example**: "The team grew brain organoids to investigate how the SARS-CoV-2 virus might affect neural tissues."
